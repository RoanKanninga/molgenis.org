**
One of the central plugins for many of the MOLGENIS databases is the data explorer. As the name suggests this is the plugin to use if you wish to take a close look at your data.
**

Note that some of the components described below are only shown if they are enabled in the application settings and to people with the appropriate permissions.

# Select entity
At the top of the data explorer the name of the currently selected entity is shown as well as the description.

In the top right corner, a dropdown is shown which can be used to select the entity you wish to display.
For admins a delete button is shown at the right side of the entity select, clicking it will allow you to choose if you which to delete only the data or also the metadata for the currently selected entity.
  
![Dataexplorer entity select](/res/images/dataexplorer/entitySelect.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/entitySelect")


# Search/Filter
In the upper left corner of the data explorer is a search box, this search box can be used to search all your data for a certain search term.
  
![Dataexplorer search](/res/images/dataexplorer/searchbox.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/searchbox")

Directly below the search box the currently active attribute filters are shown. By clicking on them they can be edited. The cross trailing every filter can be used to delete this filter. Filters can be set from the attribute selection tree which is described below.
Using the checkbox in front of each attribute the visibility of this attribute in the table can be managed. The filter icon can be used to set filters for this specific attribute.
  
![Dataexplorer active filters](/res/images/dataexplorer/active_filters.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/active_filters")

In the area with the active filters you will also find the button to open the filter wizard, this is a popup screen that allows you to add filters for different attributes in one go.

![Dataexplorer filter wizard](/res/images/dataexplorer/filterwizard.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/filterwizard")

# Different views
    
![Dataexplorer tabs](/res/images/dataexplorer/dataexplorer_tabs.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/dataexplorer_tabs")

The data explorer consists of multiple modules to view or process the data in different ways. These modules are described below:

# Data table
The data module shows the data in a table, the table can be sorted by clicking on the headers.
If your data contains references to other entities, an icon is shown to expand this reference to show the data from the referenced entity.

Every line starts, depending on your permissions with some action icons:
  
![Dataexplorer action buttons](/res/images/dataexplorer/action_buttons.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/action_buttons")

- Add row:
Using this button will open a form with inputs for all the attributes in the entity, allowing you to create a new entity.
All fields will be validated based on their datatype, for example "test" is not a valid email address.
- Edit row:
Same as the add row button, but with prefilled inputs to allow you to edit an entity.
- Inspect row:
This button will open a form with a custom made report for this row. Different reports can be created, when you have a permission to write to the FreemarkerTemplate entity.
- Delete row:
This button can be used to remove a row from the entity.

# Metadata editing (Since MOLGENIS 2.0)

A new feature of MOLGENIS 2.0 is the "Metadata editing capabilities". All data including metadata can be created, read, updated and deleted, with some restrictions though. The metadata editing capabilities will be discussed in this part of the documentation.

## Metadata main entities

There are three metadata main entities. These entities contain all info about the entities, attributes and packages in MOLGENIS and respectivally are called: EntityType, Attribute and Package.

###EntityType

EntityType contains all data about the entities in MOLGENIS. Each row in this table represents an entity in MOLGENIS.

####Editing capabilities
* Create new entities: 
  * "Forms" (Data Explorer -> EntityType -> create): "Cannot be created" 
  * "Upload" (Upload): Yes when metadata is configured correctly in the EMX
* Read: Yes 
* Update:
  * Label
  * Description
  * Abstract 
  * Tags
  * i18n fields
* Delete: Posible for non system entities.

###Attribute

Attribute contains all data about the attributes in MOLGENIS. Each row in this table represents one attribute in an MOLGENIS entity

####Editing capabilities
* Create: Yes for non system entities.
  * When creating an attribute for an existing enitity with data Nillable cannot be set to true.
* Read: Yes 
* Update: Yes for non system entities:
  * Sequence number
  * Data type:
  	* See "data types"
  * ID attribute 
  * Label attribute
  * Lookup attribute index
  * Attribute parent
  * Attribute parts
  * Referenced entity
  * Order by
  * Expression
  * Nillable
  * Auto
  * Visible
  * Label
  * Description
  * Aggregatable
  * Enum values
  * Range min
  * Range max
  * Read-only
  * Unique
  * Tags
  * Visible expression
  * Validation expression 
  * Default value
 * i18n fields
* Delete: Yes for non system entities

####Data types
Here is a list convertion allowed in the metadata edit and some motivation with some extra info.

#####BOOL
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * INT
* Motivation: 
  * TRUE and FALSE do not need another representation then the way they are, or as a string or as 0 and BOOL to dates makes no sense.
  * ENUM representation does not add anything to the existing true or false selection. 
  * Making a compound of an attribute just throws away the data. 
  * Converting to a reference does not make sense, because when will you use true or false as an identifier?

#####DATE
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * DATE_TIME
* Motivation: 
  * We do not support DATE as an ID attribute type, so no need for referencing conversions.
  * If you want to do something with your dates, convert them to STRING first and then to another type. 

#####DATE_TIME
* Allowed: 
  * STRING 
  * TEXT
  * DATE
* Motivation: 
  * We do not support DATE_TIME as an ID attribute type, so no need for referencing conversions.
  * If you want to do something with your date times, convert them to STRING first and then to another  type. 

#####INT
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * DECIMAL
  * LONG
  * BOOL
  * ENUM
  * XREF
  * CATEGORICAL
* Motivation: 
  * Conversion to DATES will throw an error, why support it? In general, conversion to COMPOUND does not make sense. 
  * Conversion to SCRIPT or HTML can be done via the STRING route.

#####LONG
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * INT
  * DECIMAL
  * ENUM
  * XREF
  * CATEGORICAL
* Motivation: 
  * Conversion to DATES will throw an error, why support it? In general, conversion to COMPOUND does not make sense. 
  * Conversion to SCRIPT or HTML can be done via the STRING route.

#####DECIMAL
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * INT
  * LONG
  * ENUM
* Motivation: 
  * DECIMAL can not be an ID attribute type, so why support that conversion? 
  * Conversion to DATES will throw an error, why support it? In general, conversion to COMPOUND does not make sense. 
  * Conversion to SCRIPT or HTML can be done via the STRING route.

#####EMAIL
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * XREF
  * CATEGORICAL
* Motivation: 
  * EMAIL format can never be numeric or a date. 
  * XREF or CATEGORICAL are a far better alternative for ENUMs.

#####HYPERLINK
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * XREF
  * CATEGORICAL
* Motivation: 
  * HYPERLINK format can never be numeric or a date. 
  * XREF or CATEGORICAL are a far better alternative for ENUMs.

#####HTML
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
  * SCRIPT
* Motivation: 
  * If HTML is properly used, you won't be able to convert it to anything else but text or script, why should we support bad data modelling habits by allowing to create dates in an HTML field, so they can convert to date types?

#####CATEGORICAL
* Allowed:
  * STRING
  * INT
  * LONG
  * XREF
* Motivation: 
  * ID types can only be STRING, INT, LONG, EMAIL and HYPERLINK. 
  * Converting to EMAIL or HYPERLINK can not be validated, so that leaves STRING, INT and LONG

#####XREF 
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * INT
  * LONG
  * CATEGORICAL
* Motivation: 
  * ID types can only be STRING, INT, LONG, EMAIL and HYPERLINK. 
  * Converting to EMAIL or HYPERLINK can not be validated, so that leaves STRING, INT and LONG

#####MREF
* Allowed: 
  * CATEGORICAL_MREF

#####CATEGORICAL_MREF
* Allowed: 
  * MREF

#####SCRIPT
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * TEXT
* Motivation: 
  * If a SCRIPT type is used properly, you will not be able to convert to anything else but STRING or TEXT

#####STRING
* Allowed: 
  * BOOL
  * DATE
  * DATE_TIME
  * DECIMAL
  * INT
  * LONG
  * HTML
  * SCRIPT
  * TEXT
  * ENUM
  * COMPOUND

#####TEXT
* Allowed: 
  * BOOL
  * DATE
  * DATE_TIME
  * DECIMAL
  * INT
  * LONG
  * HTML
  * SCRIPT
  * STRING
  * ENUM
  * COMPOUND

#####ENUM
* Allowed: 
  * STRING
  * INT
  * LONG
  * TEXT
* Motivation:
  * For ENUM it is a bit hard to decide what we should allow.
  * We figured that enum values will be strings or numbers almost always, so only support those conversions. 
  * If we have a use case for DATEs as ENUM options, we will concede!

#####COMPOUND
* Allowed: STRING
* Motivation: 
  * STRING can be converted to almost everything, and because COMPOUND never has any values, 
STRING should be a nice starting point.

#####FILE
Allowed: NONE
Motivation: not desirable functionality

#####ONE_TO_MANY
Allowed: NONE
Motivation: not desirable functionality

###Package

EntityType contains all data about the entities in MOLGENIS. Each row in this table represents an entity in MOLGENIS.

####Editing capabilities
* Create: Yes
* Read: Yes 
* Update: Yes for non system entities
  * Label
  * Description
  * Tags
* Delete: 
  * Yes for non system entities
 

### System packages, entities and attributes

System packages, entities and attributes are available in MOLGENIS 2.0 after installation. They are configured programmatically and can only be changed in new releases of the software. Changing the system packages, entities and attributes via the metadata editing functionality will be registerd in the database. When dropping the index and database this registration will be droped and the original values will be loaded again.

# Download  

At the bottom of the table there is a download button, which will allow you to save the data to a CSV of XLS file. Depending on the purpose of the download, identifiers or labels can be used as column headers. Probably the data is safest inside molgenis!
Another button will allow you to send your data to a [galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/ "Galaxy") server.

![Dataexplorer download](/res/images/dataexplorer/download_export.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/download_export")

# Genome browser
  
![Dataexplorer first screen](/res/images/dataexplorer/genome_browser.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/genome_browser")

If a selected entity has chromosome and position attribute the genome browser will be shown. The browser used by MOLGENIS is the [Dalliance](http://www.biodalliance.org "Dalliance") genome browser.
Clicking on a row in the data table will make the genome browser zoom to the coordinates of that row.
A button ('apply filters') is available at the bottom of the genome browser to filter the data table based on the coordinates currently in shown in the genome browser.


## Try it out

Upload the [vcf_example_file](/data/Documentation_VCF.vcf "VCF example file") using the importer.
Let's select an entity containing genomic variants by selecting the entity name you just chose for the upload in the entity select.
Let's assume we have a specific location we are interested in, say position 103214569 at chromosome 7, so we'd like to search for that specific line in the entity.
Let's first use the search box to see if we can find the line that way:
enter "103214569" in the search box and press enter.

But now we like to take a look at all variation on chromosome 7. As you can imagine searching for "7" in all the attributes in the data will give us a lot of results we are not looking for. So we'd like to filter for this value specifically for the chromosome attribute.

Click the filter icon in front of "#CHROM" in the attribute selection tree and enter "8" in the input field then click "apply"
However we meant to search for chromosome 7, so let's click the filter in the active filters box, and change the value to 7.
We now have all the values for chromosome 7 in the table, however the results are divided over several pages of results, we'd like to view them all in one screen; click the "rows per page" dropdown below the table and select "100" this will show 100 results per page.
The "FILTER" column shows the same value for every line, we are not interested in this column so let's hide it by clicking the checkbox in front of "#CHROM" in the attribute selection tree.

Click any column header in the table to sort the data based on that column, click again to sort in the opposite direction.
Click one of the lines in the data table to zoom to the position of this variant in the genome browser.
Click the symbol in front of the "SAMPLES" column header to show the columns belonging to the samples.

Click the magnifying glass in front of the dataline to show a report for that line. The default report is just showing all attribute values in a structured way. However, as stated above, all kinds of reports can be added at runtime.

# Inline editing

Click the edit icon and change the chromosome from 7 to 8 and save.
Adding a row works the same way, only without the prefilled fields.
Now let's click the red garbage bin icon in front of a line to delete this line from the entity.

TODO: add figure

# Annotators

The annotator module of the data explorer is the user interface to use the MOLGENIS annotator framework, which can also be used from the command-line.
The annotator framework is a system to add data from other resources to your genomic entities. For example pathogenicity prediction, allele frequencies and phenotype information.

![Dataexplorer annotators](/res/images/dataexplorer/annotators.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/annotators")

The screen shows a list of available annotators that can be used. Clicking the title of the annotator will result in a popup with additional information such as a general description and a listing of the attributes that will be added by this annotator.
Using the checkboxes multiple annotators can be selected for one run, which is started by clicking the "annotate" button. If preferred a copy of the dataset can be created with the annotations added to this copy, leaving the original entity as it is.
Annotated fields will be added to the entity in a compound attribute.

On the right hand side of the screen a list of unavailable annotators is shows, the reason why they are unavailable is shown in the list, this can for example be due to a resource being unavailable or an attribute needed to map the entity and resource to each other missing.
The gear icon trailing every annotator in the list can be used to configure the settings for this annotator.

# Aggregation

The aggregation module allows you to produce aggregated counts for queries on the data.

The screen has 2 areas, the controls and the results, the controls allow you to choose the attributes you wish to use for the aggregation.

![Dataexplorer aggregates](/res/images/dataexplorer/aggregate_controls.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/aggregates")

You can select 1 attribute for simple one dimensional counts, represented as a table with one column, or two attributes to get a 2 dimensional aggregate table.
A third dropdown allows you to select an attribute by which to group the results.

![Dataexplorer aggregate results](/res/images/dataexplorer/aggregate_result_table.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/aggregateresults")

These functionalities are best explained by the example in the "try it out section below".

## try it out
Upload [emx_example_file](/data/Documentation_EMX.xlsx "EMX example file") through the importer.
Navigate to the data explorer and select the aggregates tab. Select the just uploaded "biobanks" entity.

Now select "patientid" in the entity dropdown.
You now get a 1 dimensional list of counts, showing you that every patient has 3 entries in the selected entity

Now select "biobank" in the first aggregate dropdown and in the second select "sampletype"
You now get a table representing the amount of samples in both biobanks per type.

Finally select "patientid" in the third dropdown, the distinct attribute. 
The table will update to show you to show you how many patients with at least one sample of a specific type are available in a biobank.

# Charts
For the chart capabilities of MOLGENIS we use the [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com "Highcharts") library.

MOLGENIS currently offers two types of plots for your data, the scatter plot and the box plot.

![Dataexplorer charts](/res/images/dataexplorer/charts.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/charts")

## scatter plot [Scatter_plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot "Scatter plot")
![Dataexplorer charts create scatterplot](/res/images/dataexplorer/create scatter plot.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/scatterplot")

For the scatterplot 2 attributes are selected to make the plot, optionally a third attribute can be selected to split the dots in groups using different shapes and colours per group. Optionally you can provide a title for your plot.

![Dataexplorer charts scatterplot](/res/images/dataexplorer/scatter plot.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/scatterplot")

## box plot [Box_plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot "Box plot")

![Dataexplorer aggregate create box plot](/res/images/dataexplorer/create box plot.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/createboxplot")

For the box plot 1 attribute (feature) is to be selected to make the plot, optionally a second attribute can be selected to split the dots in groups. Optionally you can provide a title for your plot.

![Dataexplorer charts box plot](/res/images/dataexplorer/boxplot.png?raw=true, "dataexplorer/boxplot")

# Reports
The reports functionality is made for overriding the default instance view or to add an instances tab in the Data-explorer. Overriding the views or adding a tab is possible by creating a new `FreemarkerTemplate` entity with the right name convention. In this short tutorial I will show you how to achieve this.

There are two ways to create your own reports: 

1. Overriding the default instance view.
2. Add one or more instances view tabs.

You will need:

1. A data set: "Advanced data example" ([download](/data/advanced_data_example_v20151104.xlsx)). Upload this dataset into your MOLGENIS instance see the [Upload guide](guide-upload).

###### Override the entity view

Steps:

1. Go to the Data Explorer
2. Select the "cities" entity via the entity select dropdown.
3. The entity view modal is opened when you click on the ![View entity report button](/res/images/reports/view-entityreport-button.png?raw=true, "Entity view") button".
4. The default view will be: ![View entity report default](/res/images/reports/default-entityreport-view.png?raw=true, "Entity view")
5. Let's upload our own template. 
	a. Go to the data explorer and select the FreemarkerTemplate entity.
	b. Click on the ![add](/res/images/add.png?raw=true, "add") button. In the modal you fill in:
		* Name: view-entityreport-specific-root_hospital_cities.ftl (view-entityreport-specific-\<Full entity name>.ftl)
		* Value: "\<div>City name: ${entity.get('cityName')}\</div>"
	![view-Cities-entitiesreport](/res/images/reports/view-entityreport-specific-root_hospital_cities.png?raw=true, "view-Cities-entitiesreport")
6. Repeat steps 2 and 3. 
7. The new view will be: ![View entity report custom](/res/images/reports/custom-entityreport-view.png?raw=true, "Entity view")

###### Add an instances view tab
1. Go to the data explorer select the "cities" entity via the th entity select dropdown.
2. Let's upload our own template. 
	a. Go to the data explorer and select the FreemarkerTemplate entity.
	b. Click on the ![add](/res/images/add.png?raw=true, "add") button. In the modal you fill in:

Name: ```view-Cities-entitiesreport.ftl (view-<template name>-entitiesreport.ftl)```

Value: 
```javascript

3. Click on the settings icon ![Settings](res/images/settings.png?raw=true, "Settings")
	a. Check: Modules -> Data -> Reports -> Yes
	b. Set: Reports -> Reports -> root_hospital_cities:Cities
		* root_hospital_cities is the entity name.
		* Cities is the template name.

4. Refresh the page and repeat step 1.
5. The result:![Custom entities report](/res/images/reports/custom-entities-report.png?raw=true, "Custom entities report")


# Model registry
The model registry is a module that can display the entire meta data model of a data set. This means that you do not look at the actual data, but you can see how the data is modelled. This is useful for detecting errors in your model, or if you want to base your own model on something that already exists.

![Model registry screen 1](/res/images/model_registry_screen1.png?raw=true, "model registry screen 1")

The following paragraphs will explain how the model registry works, but it is more fun to learn how it works with some actual models. So for this part, you can go to [The BioMedBridges](https://molgenis08.target.rug.nl/menu/main/standardsregistry) website, and navigate to the model registry module, you do not even have to log in!

Now that we have some actual models on our screen, let's get started by finding some models. I know! Why don't we search for the EMX model? You should be familiar with it since you probably imported your own data already. In the main model registry screen, search for EMX. You should get one model back, namely emx (Entity Model eXtensible). As you can see there are a few links mentioned as well. These are *Tags*, if you do not know the term, I suggest you look at the [Upload guide](guide-upload) again. The label beneath the Tags tells you why this model was returned for your search.

This part is not telling us much about the content of the EMX model yet, so let's see what it holds! Click the *View Model Details* button to get to the details page.

![Model registry screen 2](/res/images/model_registry_screen2.png?raw=true, "model registry screen 2")

Here you can see a tree on the left and a large middle section containing all the meta data. You can also view a UML diagram of your entire package, and even print out a document containing the overview of your model.

**The tree**  
The tree is a simplified overview of all the tables, or entities, inside a package. Clicking on the Molgenis Field Types entity for example, will take you to the detailed description of that entity. You can also expand an entity, to see all its attributes. Clicking an attribute will take you to the description of that attribute.

**The details**  
The details for every entity and attribute is an overview of data types, constraints, default values, and descriptions. 

**UML**
Navigate to the UML tab to see a UML representation of your model. You can zoom in and out using the + and - buttons. You can also drag around the different boxes to rearrange the diagram.

**Printing**
You can print your model to review it on paper by pressing the print button at the top right of the screen.
